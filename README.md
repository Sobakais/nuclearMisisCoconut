### Project Title: Detecting Smoking in Restricted Areas

### Team Name: MISIScoconut

#### Team Members
- Dmitriy Urosov
- Mihail Gumirov
- Maria Haudukova
- Danil Sinitsin

#### Overview
This project is a submission by Team MISIScoconut for the Nuclear IT Hack hackathon. The goal of the project is to train a YOLOv8 model to detect whether there is a person smoking in a restricted area from CCTV screenshots. The detection of smoking in prohibited areas can help in enforcing no-smoking policies and improving compliance.

#### Project Structure
- data: Contains the dataset people smoking in different circumstances for training and testing the model.
- models: Includes the YOLOv8 model architecture and weights after training.
- scripts: Contains scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and inference.
- results: Stores the results of model evaluation and detection on test images.

#### Future Improvements
- Fine-tuning the model for better detection performance.
- Include pose detection in the model.
- Integration via biometric data to fine citizens.
